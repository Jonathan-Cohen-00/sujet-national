<h1>Reasons to Worship Linux 🙌🐧<br>…and Why GAFAM Might Make You Raise an Eyebrow 👀</h1>

<ul>
    <!-- SERIOUS BEGIN -->
    <li>Linux is open-source, giving you full transparency and control over what runs on your machine.</li>

    <li>It powers most of the world’s supercomputers, cloud servers, and scientific research infrastructure.</li>

    <li>Linux systems respect your privacy by default — no telemetry, no forced data collection.</li>

    <li>It offers long-term stability without surprise updates restarting your machine without consent.</li>

    <li>Linux is free, maintained by thousands of volunteers and professionals worldwide.</li>

    <li>Package managers like apt, pacman, or dnf make installing software extremely safe and clean.</li>

    <li>Linux can revive old hardware that proprietary systems abandon as “obsolete”.</li>

    <li>The community is global, vibrant, collaborative, and constantly improving the ecosystem.</li>

    <li>You have the freedom to customize your environment: window managers, themes, kernels, everything.</li>

    <li>Linux is used in critical systems — airplanes, medical devices, financial infrastructure — because of its reliability.</li>

    <!-- TRANSITION ZONE -->
    <li>Unlike certain companies, Linux doesn’t ask you 36 times if you agree to cookies before doing anything.</li>

    <li>You don’t have to buy a new laptop every three years because an update decided your battery is “not compatible with happiness”.</li>

    <li>Linux doesn’t randomly install apps you never asked for, like weather widgets from companies that track your soul.</li>

    <li>No one forces you to create an account just to open your own computer like you’re logging into a hotel Wi-Fi.</li>

    <li>Linux never sends your search history to advertisers, no matter how cursed your 3am Google sessions get.</li>

    <!-- FULLY ABSURD -->
    <li>Each Linux installation emits a faint celestial glow visible only to true believers.</li>

    <li>When you open a terminal, you gain +3 confidence and +7 hacker aura.</li>

    <li>Using Linux automatically grants you protection from 87% of digital demons and 100% of corporate nonsense.</li>

    <li>If you successfully install Arch Linux, a wise penguin appears in your dreams and says “You are ready.”</li>

    <li>Linux servers run so efficiently that one of them once achieved enlightenment.</li>

    <li>Every time you uninstall Windows, an angel gets its wings — and Bill Gates feels a small tickle.</li>

    <li>The penguin mascot has been scientifically proven* to reduce stress.</li>

    <li>Some say that if you type “sudo” three times in front of a mirror, Richard Stallman appears and hands you a USB key.</li>

    <li>Linux users are rumored to receive one free chocolate bar per month directly from the Penguin Council.</li>

    <li>Certain versions of Linux are so fast that time actually moves quicker while they boot.</li>

    <li>Legend says that deep inside the kernel, there is a comment saying “✨ Believe in yourself ✨”.</li>

    <li>Using Linux keeps the tech demons at bay, including the one who makes your printer refuse to work before deadlines.</li>

    <li>If everyone used Linux, the world would be at peace and all PDFs would open correctly on the first try.</li>
</ul>
